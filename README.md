## Scope and Limitations

This review relies exclusively on publicly available records, including:

- IRS Forms 990 (2013–2024)
- The 2025 settlement agreement
- California Secretary of State filings
- Recorded property records
- Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index reference data

Certain financial structures referenced in the settlement, including donor-advised funds, do not provide donor account–level public transparency. Where necessary, exhibits present illustrative modeling assumptions based on available data and clearly state their limitations.

These analyses are not formal appraisals, audits, or performance determinations. They are presented for contextual review of publicly reported information.
